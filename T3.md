TP 3 : Programmation en Langage Forth
=====================================

The answers must be sent to <pablo.oliveira@prism.uvsq.fr> with the following subject "[ASE] TP3 nom1 nom2 ...".

We will use the minimal forth that we studied in lecture 3.

Download the tar.gz at <http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=snapshot;h=66c56998125f3ac265a3a1df9821fd52cfeee8cc;sf=tgz>

Uncompress it using tar xzvf file.tar.gz

Get into the jonesforth directory and change line 11 from Makefile to:

~~~bash
gcc -m32 -nostdlib -static -o $@ $<
~~~

Type make clean all test.

To load forth definitions from a file type:

~~~bash
  $ cat jonesforth.f file.fs - | ./jonesforth
~~~

WARNING IN JONESFORTH INSTEAD OF WRITING "' DOCOL" WRITE JUST "DOCOL" FOR ALL OTHER
WORDS, LIKE EXIT, IT IS FINE TO USE "' EXIT", THIS IS A BUG


Simple Forth programs
---------------------

Beware, Jonesforth do not support the ``DO I LOOP`` construct. You can
still use ``REPEAT``, ``UNTIL``, ``BEGIN``, ``WHILE``, ``AGAIN`` or ``RECURSE``. 


(@) Define the word COUNT-TO ( n ) that prints the numbers from 1 to n to stdout.

(@) Define the word FACT ( n -- n ) that computes the factorial of an integer.

(@) Define the word PALINDROME? ( addr len -- f ) that returns true if a string is a palindrom.

(@) Define the word 3MAX ( a b c -- n ) that returns the max of the top three elements in the stack.  
   Try to factorize your definition in two words to make it simple to read.


Memory
------

These words are already defined in ``jonesforth.f``, but do not look at them.
Try to find by yourself how to define them.

(@) Define the word CONSTANT as described in the lecture.

   Reminder:

~~~forth
   10 CONSTANT TEN ( creates a word that pushes 10 into the stack )

   TEN . CR 
   10
~~~

(@) Define the word VAR that creates a new global variable. Example of use:

~~~forth
   VAR A
   0 A ! ( WRITES 0 into A )
   A @ . CR 
   0
   42 A !
   A @ . CR
   42
~~~

(@) Define the word ARRAY that creates a new array. 
   Example of use:

~~~forth
   10 ARRAY A ( defines a 10 slots ARRAY )
~~~

   Define the word SLOT that returns the nth slot of the array.
   ``A 5 SLOT`` returns the address of the 5th slot of array A

   ``42 A 5 SLOT !``  writes 42 in the 5th slot of the array A
   ``A 5 SLOT @`` reads the 5th slot of the array A


Control
-------

These words are already defined in ``jonesforth.f``, but do not look at them.
Try to find by yourself how to define them.

(@) Define the words ``_IF _THEN``.
(@) Define the words ``_REPEAT _AGAIN``.
(@) (Hard and optional, only for the bravest) Define the words ``DO I LOOP``.
